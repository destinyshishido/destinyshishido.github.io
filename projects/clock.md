This project is a simple digital clock that I created in my freshman year of high school, when I was still relatively new to coding. The clock features a simple display of the current time with hours, minutes, and seconds. It also has a colour-changing border, a feature that I thought was super creative at the time and was super proud of.
This was the first project that I did in high school that used JavaScript! As I am writing this, I am in ICS 314, a class that focuses on learning JavaScript. In hindsight, I can see that I had no idea how much I didn't know when I made this in 2016. It is a very simple project but holds a special place in my heart, as it was one of the first times where I realized how much I enjoyed coding.
