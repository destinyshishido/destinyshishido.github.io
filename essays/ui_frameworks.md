## Treacherous CSS
I have had my fair share of frustration that comes with using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to design user interfaces. However, I believe it is an experience that every programmer needs to go through to learn, grow, and become a better programmer. CSS is a very powerful language that has infinite possibilities, but it is very tedious to design your website exactly how you want. For simple websites, CSS works fine but to create more intricate ones, using a CSS framework can be life-changing. There are a bunch of CSS frameworks out there, all with different focuses such as Bootstrap, Bulma, Tailwind, and more!

## What is a framework?
So, what exactly is a CSS framework?
CSS frameworks are libraries that come pre-written with CSS code that can be used to design the front end of websites. The pre-written code comes with pre-defined user interface components, styling, and layout systems. With the pre-defined elements, youâ€™ll save many many lines of code and a whole bunch of time. It makes it easy to make websites aesthetically appealing and consistent throughout the entire page. Every framework has its own website where you can learn about all the features it has, making it really easy to learn and search for help. There are so many components in each framework and it definitely takes a while to master it, but it is definitely worth the time and effort in the long run. It is also nice that you can use the framework but still use CSS to fine-tune your designs.

## Stay Strapped
One of the most well-known CSS frameworks is called Bootstrap and it is also the first framework that I learned! Prior to learning Bootstrap, I dreaded designing websites with straight CSS and HTML, but I now realize how much I enjoy front-end web development. So far, I have learned that Bootstrap makes it extremely easy to implement navigation bars, dropdowns, forms, and buttons, and to build responsive rows and columns. With Bootstrap, I can create a usable and aesthetically pleasing layout in minutes, something that would take hours using plain CSS. I hope to use Bootstrap more in the future and use it to its fullest, as well as learn other frameworks to expand my toolbelt.
