<p>Learning about web application development has been super interesting, and I hope to dive deeper in the future! I have learned a lot about my workflow and how I learn best through all the practice that I’ve had. Countless hours and many all-nighters have been spent practicing and re-doing coding exercises and I do not regret any of it. Learning how to use new development environments and user interface frameworks was the main learning points for me, although we touched upon many other aspects of software development.</p>

<h2 id="development-environments">Development Environments</h2>
<p>Thanks to my Software Engineering professor Cam Moore, I was introduced to my best friend IntelliJ IDEA. This is one of many Integrated Development Environments (IDE) and is my favorite that I’ve used so far due to its helpful features and ease of use. IDEs are software applications that allow programmers to develop efficiently by combining many common developer tools into one application. One way that IDE’s help is by color coding your code (no pun intended), it automatically colors your code depending on if it’s a variable, a class, a method, etc. Without color coding, I find that coding is extremely overwhelming, so this feature is a must for me. Another feature that I use heavily is the autocomplete feature. Autocomplete gives code suggestions based on the first few characters you type and can save lots of time and hand cramps (haha). It can anticipate what function you are trying to call, what variable you want to reference, and so on. The last feature I want to mention, and arguably the most helpful, is the debugging feature. This feature underlines and points out errors in code and provides suggestions on how to solve them. It is super handy for finding tiny mistakes, such as a missing semicolon or parenthesis. The many keyboard shortcuts can save lots of time during coding which I appreciate, but is something I need to take more time to learn. Previously I had been using Visual Studio Code (VSC) which worked fine, but I never took the time to learn how to use it well. VSC has served me well during my high school years and my first couple of years of college, but IntelliJ IDEA has taken its place in my toolbox. I believe it is a useful skill to be able to learn how to use new development environments and not be confined to just one.</p>

<h2 id="user-interface-frameworks">User Interface Frameworks</h2>
<p>Without User Interface Frameworks, everyone would be stuck designing websites for unnecessary amounts of time. UI Frameworks make the world go round, and more importantly, keep developers sane!
But what exactly is a UI Framework??
UI Frameworks are collections of pre-built libraries, components, and other design classes. They are super helpful in web design because they allow the developer to make visually appealing websites much faster since they will be referencing pre-made code! Developers have to worry less about breakpoints and catering to different window sizes as well as cross-platform compatibility. This along with the ability to use and style pre-made components is life-changing, especially if you start with only knowing Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). In addition to efficiency, the design of your website will be much more consistent throughout all the pages and just look way cleaner.
So far throughout my Software Engineering journey, I have used Vue and Bootstrap which are both very easy to learn and use. I love that UI Frameworks have very in-depth websites that you can reference to pick the best components to use for your intended purposes. There are also many sources online that have advice on styling these components, as these frameworks are used by millions of people. Just like IDE’s, it is valuable to know how to use multiple UI Frameworks as they all have different strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<h2 id="big-takeaways">Big Takeaways</h2>
<p>Overall, software engineering has been a big learning experience for me and I can’t wait to improve! It has taught me a lot about creating web applications along with using tools like integrated development environments and various user interface frameworks, which have saved me a lot of blood, sweat, and tears. But, just like anything else I have lots to learn and improve on, and I can’t wait to see what else I am capable of creating with all this new knowledge and skills.</p>
