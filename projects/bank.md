This Bank Database was a small project that I did for my ICS 212 class in Fall 2022. This program stores bank records which store a user's name, account number, and address. Records can be added, deleted, or searched for through the command line.

Prior to this class, I had no knowledge of C or C++ and this project really tested my skills. I learned that coding with C is extremely tricky and it took a lot of work to get to the finished product. Specifically, dealing with user inputs was very difficult because of possible errors in type differences as well as dealing with incorrectly formatted user input.
