## Take Your Code to the Cleaner
Keeping your code neat has no downsides and, if anything, will help improve your coding experience. “Neat” code in my opinion means that the code is clear, readable, and consistent. This means appropriate usage of comments, spaces (tabs, spaces, newlines), whitespace, and variable/method names. There are a lot more rules and patterns to follow in coding standards, but those are the main few. Although maintaining clean code can be challenging for some, you are not on your own. On its own code style sounds tedious, but you can set up your integrated development environment (IDE) to do most of the work for you. You can upload your own style sheets if there is a certain standard you want to use and it is a super easy one-time setup. After that, you can fix most of the common problems in a couple of clicks with the recommended code fixes.

## Error Finding and Fixing
From previous experience, I have found that it is a lot easier to point out errors in my code when I follow a specific code style. In specific, I always keep the amount of spaces and whitespace consistent throughout everything, This way, when some part is done incorrectly, it will look different and I will spend less time scrolling through trying to find where the error occurred. I also find that adding comments helps me find errors more easily and overall makes my code more readable. I like to add comments in my code to help with the readability, actual sentences are much easier to understand than millions of lines of code. This is especially helpful if you are working in a team because your teammates will be able to navigate it much easier. Commenting also helps with fixing errors, as you can find the comment at which some parts may be causing problems. Although simple, these small practices can save a lot of time and energy in the long run!

## Conventions
Other than spacing and commenting, there are many other small style guides that aren’t necessarily required but are expected. If you don’t follow these, you are at risk of being shunned by the community and more importantly will have a harder time reading through your code. It is in best practice to use camel case when naming variables and functions, for example “goodVariableName” and “goodFunctionName()”. These names are a lot easier to read compared to “goodvariablename” or “goodfunctionname()”. When coming up with names for variables and functions, it is good to come up with names that explain what it will be used for. Some variable names like “x”, “y”, and “z” are okay to use but do not show what the variable is used for at all, and may cause confusion while coding.
Overall, coding standards are a simple way to keep your code readable and easy to understand. With practice, following these guidelines will come as second nature and will improve your experience with coding. Digging for errors and typos will no longer consume unnecessary amounts of time and working with other developers will become easier, and they will be very thankful.
