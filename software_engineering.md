## Choosing my Path
Growing up, I had many different aspirations for what I wanted my career to be. Some of which were silly, like being an astronaut or a professional competition eater. Others still sound like I would thoroughly enjoy, like being a teacher or a chef. All of these options sound amazing and fun but I don’t think it is what I want to do for the rest of my life, so I’ve decided to keep those as funny dreams and hobbies instead. Coding is what I have chosen to do and I am really interested in learning more about Software Engineering!

## Motivated by Support
The idea of being a software engineer was planted in my brain by my grandma. Eight years ago, there was a lot of talk about how coding was the next big job opportunity and I was heavily encouraged to pursue that. My grandma suggested that I try it out and soon I joined the coding club at school and was taking classes on coding at Sylvan. Growing up playing games on computers, I found these activities to be really interesting and engaging. This carried into high school where I joined the Academy of Information Technology and learned more about coding and even got to participate in various code challenges/hackathons. I am very grateful that my school gave me those opportunities to learn and practice.

## Future Goals
Now, I am a third-year student at the University of Hawai`i at Manoa and I am enjoying being a computer science major. I still am looking forward to having new experiences and finding exactly what I want to do with this degree I am working towards. Video game design and web design have always been of interest to me and I hope to dabble into those two a little before I graduate. Although I am not completely sure of what job I want, I am excited to gain lots of knowledge through them and I know that I will enjoy the journey!
