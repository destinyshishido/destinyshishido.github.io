## Developing Developer
In order to improve as a developer, you need to exhibit a desire for learning and improvement. Becoming a better developer can come from learning on your own or through classes, but not everything can be understood right off the bat. Bumps in the road, or bumps in the code, can hold us back from completing a project, cause frustration, and overall limit our learning. To combat this, asking questions is essential! This is one of the things I have learned over the past few years during all of my classes, especially my computer science classes. Personally, I have had difficulty asking questions because I was worried about what the professor or other classmates may think of me. I’ve grown a lot since then and have realized that I shouldn’t let these worries hold me back. As long as you have put in your best effort, you are showing that you care about the material and are trying to improve.

## “No Such Thing as a Stupid Question”
Growing up, many teachers have preached “There’s no such thing as a stupid question.” The point of this claim is to encourage students to ask questions and to expand their knowledge, to not be ashamed to ask for help if they are confused. The premise of this statement is sweet, but the truth is there can be stupid questions if the student lacks the motivation to actually learn or has not put in the effort to solve the question they are asking. This applies to questions regarding software engineering, too! When asking questions regarding coding, we want to ask smart questions. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77047605/how-to-use-react-js-to-convert-pdf-to-image">Here</a> is an example of a bad question. We can see that the developer asked “How to use React.js to convert Pdf to Image?” which is the first red flag, this question is too vague and is asking for help writing the entire thing. Asking vague questions shows that not much effort was put into solving the problem. This specific question could have been searched up and would likely have existing answers elsewhere. Looking deeper into the post, the developer provided his entire program's code, forcing other developers to read through and find the issues. This makes the question harder to answer, and lowers the chances of this question being answered correctly!

## Be “Smart”
Now, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77047829/how-to-rotate-the-image-while-keeping-its-actual-dimensions">here</a> is an example of a “smart” question. Before asking any question, ask yourself, “Can I find the answer to this question anywhere else?” Oftentimes, the same, or similar, questions have already been asked and answered on forums, covered by websites, or can be answered by a friend who is also a developer. Now that you’ve put in your best effort to solve this problem and have searched high and low for the answer, you have every right to ask. To receive the best and most helpful answers, make sure your question is specific and concise. Developers are far more likely to reply if no further questions need to be asked about the actual problem. Provide the problem you are encountering along with a snippet of code that is causing the problem. If possible, include the error messages you are receiving and the different ways you tried to remedy the problem that were unsuccessful. All of this information will help others understand what is really wrong, and will be able to give you the answer sooner! If you are posting your question to a resource like Stack Overflow, it is also important to post your question to the right topics, this will make sure it is directed to the right audience. Lastly, don’t forget to be polite! Everyone is learning and wants everyone else to do the same, it is important to create a safe space for everyone to ask and answer questions.
