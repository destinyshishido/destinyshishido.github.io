<p>Manoa Melody is a web application for the University of Hawaii at Manoa students to form connections based on music, instruments, and genre interests. I loved this idea for the project because I myself am a music enthusiast. I listen to around 100,000 minutes of music every year and I love talking about music with others and going to concerts. Manoa Melody opens the doors for other music enthusiasts to not only meet those with similar interests but also provide them with opportunities to go to events that are catered to them.
Users are able to create an account with an email and password and are then able to create their own profile for others to see! They can choose their display name, instrument interests, and genre interests, and can add any additional information to their bio. Users can view everyone elseâ€™s profiles and can also upload/view upcoming musical events along with their tagged instruments and genres.</p>

<p>This web application was designed using Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/) and Meteor (https://www.meteor.com/). This was my first time creating an application using both of these JavaScript UI frameworks and I can confidently say that my Software Engineering class (ICS314) prepared me well for this! These frameworks were very helpful in keeping our website design consistent throughout all the pages.</p>

<p>## Contributions
The group as a whole brainstormed the idea of the app along with the pages that we wanted to implement. I was able to contribute to this project by creating and designing the Explore Profiles page. The Explore Profiles page displays the profiles of all registered users of Manoa Melody. This includes their profile picture, display name, music genre interests, music genre interests, bio, and email. Users can use this page to make friends and gives them an idea of who they might get along with best! It was important to make sure this page was adaptable to different window sizes while displaying all information from the Profiles collection correctly. I also contributed by form-fitting the Profiles collection to hold all the user data that we needed for the app.
I learned a lot about both Bootstrap and Meteor MongoDB collections during this project.</p>
