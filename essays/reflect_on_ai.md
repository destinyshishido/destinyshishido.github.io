## Introduction
Over the course of the semester, I have just barely dabbled in using AI to assist me with my ICS314 assignments. AI is a powerful tool that most professors do not allow, but it was cool to see a class where it is openly talked about. AI can be a developer's best friend, but only if they use it ethically and have a true desire for learning.

## Personal Experience with AI
1. For the experience WODs (Workout of the Day), I never had to turn to AI for help. The experience WODs had very detailed instructions and were decently easy to figure out. If ever had trouble with them I would simply watch the YouTube video provided for that specific WOD, which I believe gave me the answers I needed faster than using AI. Sometimes I would even watch the YouTube video multiple times in order to understand the content better.
2. During the in-class practice WOD I did not use AI because I felt that I was able to actually learn the content better through making mistakes. By making mistakes on the practice WOD I would have to problem-solve or search through documentation to find what I was looking for. I also could ask for help from my peers which I enjoy a lot more than using AI.
3. The in-class WODs were definitely more difficult than the experience WODs and the practice WODs just because of the time limit. However, I did not resort to using AI for these because I felt that I had a good enough understanding to solve them on my own. Mentally, I never allowed myself to use AI on the in-class WODs and it forced me to try to understand the content well beforehand. The in-class practice WODs were very similar so I made sure I was able to do those before going into the in-class WODs.
4. I did not use AI when writing the essays for this course. The essays were very personal and usually asked about my own experiences, so I felt it was unnecessary to use AI to write them.
5. So far, I have not used AI while working on my final project. I feel that I have learned a lot during this course, enough to get me through most of my final project. If I do need extra help, I will just ask my groupmates or the professor.
6. I have not had to use AI to learn a concept or for a tutorial, the videos and practices in class have been sufficient! I also learn better by asking a friend to explain it rather than through AI.
7. When answering a question in class or on Discord, I did not use AI. If I did not know the answer, I would just wait for the answer to be told aloud and learn from that instead.
8. When asking questions, I almost never use AI to find answers, I usually ask my peers or search through Stack Overflow if I am desperate. I am interested to know if asking these questions to AI will be accurate and give me the answer I am looking for though!
9. When we were learning Underscore and Bootstrap, I did search for code examples to understand the syntax of these new tools. Google does a good job of using AI to give short but understandable examples that were very helpful.
10. I never used AI to explain a piece of code, instead, I would read through documentation to learn exactly what each piece of code does individually. I think that learning it on my own this way helped solidify my knowledge. Reading about it on my own definitely makes the information stick more and I am more able to apply it.
11. When writing code, it was tempting to try to use AI to do the work for me, but I felt that if I did that, I would get too reliant on it. Instead, I did all the code myself and if I needed to, I would look for similar code examples from past WODs in order to learn how to write the code I needed.
12. I did not use AI for documenting code, I found it pretty easy to do on my own. I thought it would be important to be able to do this without AI so I could understand what each piece of code does and explain it well.
13. I did not use AI for quality assurance, I was able to debug my code pretty well just by reading through the errors thrown. I think it is a good skill to be able to debug or fix style errors on your own. By doing it on your own, you can be sure to code better initially rather than going back to fix things with AI later. By doing this, I was able to learn how to code within ESLint rules and I barely encountered errors for it.

## Impact on Learning and Understanding
Being allowed to use AI as a tool for ICS314 was surprising to me, as this was the first class I have taken that embraced it. Depending on how you use AI, it can be both beneficial and detrimental. I believe I use AI well because I use it only when I think it is the most optimal way for me to learn and problem-solve. It is great for understanding how to code because you may not be able to find such specific examples elsewhere. With AI, you can ask much more specific questions and find more tailored solutions, but by searching Google you will find much more broad solutions. Overall, I think that AI has enhanced my understanding of software engineering concepts!

## Practical Applications
The most common place that we see AI is in place of customer service jobs. For example, Amazon utilizes AI to help all customers with any complaints or problems. It is a great way for them to help customers with simple recurring problems and also reduce wait times for customers who truly need to talk to a customer service representative. 

## Challenges and Opportunities
The biggest challenge with AI is being able to format your questions in a way that would result in the correct answer. If AI was able to read your mind and solve the problems for you, it would be incredibly easy to get through this course. However, it is not that simple and we must learn this new skill of asking smart questions.

## Comparative Analysis
Traditional teaching methods are put to the test now that AI-enhanced learning is up and coming. In terms of software engineering, I think that AI would be very effective at teaching code but not everyone is able to learn this way. Everyone has different learning styles, for example, some people may simply learn better by hearing the content from an actual professor. Professors are also able to lay out courses in a way that they believe would be the easiest to learn. Traditional teaching methods are definitely more beneficial when it comes to practical skill development as they allow students to have human interaction and develop social skills, which is arguably more important than learning how to code.

## Future Considerations
Overall, I think that AI is a powerful tool that should be allowed in the Software Engineering Course. As long as the student makes it their own goal to learn, they will be able to use AI to speed up that process and it will lead to more learning and less frustration. I think it would be beneficial to learn exactly how to ask AI questions to get the right answers. The way that questions are asked is vital to using AI effectively and not everyone knows how to do so.

## Conclusion
I feel lucky to live in an era where AI exists and I am glad that ICS314 allowed us to utilize it. For software engineering, it would be very hard to do well in this class solely relying on AI so I believe that it is okay for it to be allowed in this course. Having AI on your side is powerful but a lot of skill is needed to use it properly. It is also a big responsibility to commit to actually learning the content rather than trying to depend on it to get by. In the future, it would be very interesting see classes on how to use AI effectively, and could potentially help students harness the power of AI to enhance their learning even more.
