Waipahu High School Tools is a web application that I helped create as a team project in 2019, we submitted this project to the Congressional App Challenge. The project helped me learn how to design and implement a responsive website.

WHS Tools was implemented using Vue.js (https://vuejs.org/), a JavaScript Framework. This web application is meant to make registering for classes easier, as it can be overwhelming for high school students. It provides an online list of all classes available, along with descriptions, prerequisites, and requirements. Students can also check if they are eligible for Academic or CTE Honors.
