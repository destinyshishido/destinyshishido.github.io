Waipahu High School Tools is a web application that I helped create as a team project in 2019, we submitted this project to the Congressional App Challenge. The project helped me learn how to design and implement a responsive website, as well as helped me familiarize myself with GitHub and having multiple people work on the same project. I am grateful that I had the opportunity in high school to learn how to use GitHub, as it is a key tool in the Software Engineering scene.

WHS Tools was implemented using Vue.js (https://vuejs.org/), a JavaScript Framework. This was my first time working with any type of Framework and I learned that it makes life so much easier. This web application is meant to make registering for classes easier, as it can be overwhelming for high school students. It provides an online list of all classes available, along with descriptions, prerequisites, and requirements. Students can also check if they are eligible for Academic or CTE Honors. The idea for this app was brainstormed by my group as we thought about what would have helped us during our high school years. We went through a few different layouts for this website and it helped me see what looks and works best for websites in terms of user interface.
